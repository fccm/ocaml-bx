First a magic tag

Write all the strings:
  [INT: the number of strings], then n STRING_DEF

STRING_DEF: [INT: length of the string], n octets
  (not null terminated)
  string definitions are indexed from 0 until n-1

STRING: [INT: the index of a STRING_DEF]

INT:
  If an int is an index for elements of a table that contains N elements
  we know what the minimum and maximum values are for that int.
  - ints that has to represent something in the range [0, 255] (bounds included)
    are stored with 1 octet.
  - for the range [0, 65535] use 2 octets
  - for the range [0, 16777215] use 3 octets

OPENING_TAG: 0x01 STRING, ATTRIBUT_LIST

ATTRIBUT_LIST: [INT: number of attributs], n ATTRIBUT's

ATTRIBUT: STRING, STRING

CLOSING_TAG: 0x02

PCDATA: 0x03 STRING

0x04 -- opening tag with namespace, and attrs without
0x05 -- opening tag without ns, but attrs with
0x06 -- both opening tag and attrs with ns
